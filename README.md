# Tailwind Plus Issue Tracker

This is where we keep track of any bugs discovered in [Tailwind Plus](https://tailwindcss.com/plus).

**Please note the issue tracker is not for technical support questions.** Because every project is different and the way independently authored pieces of code interact can be complex and time-consuming to understand, we do not offer technical support or consulting as part of your purchase.
